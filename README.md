Grocery List App

-This app will be used to create a grocery list based off the items you need for each visit. 
-The user will be able to add any item they'd like and add it to their list along with incrementing and decrementing the quantity. 
-It'll be organized into 11 categories (Beverages, Bakery, Canned Goods, Dairy, Dry/Baking Goods, Frozen Foods, Meat/Seafood, Produce, Personal Care, Household Supplies, Other). 
-I'd also like to add a feature to check off/cross off as you shop.
-The user will be able to delete inidivudal items to edit the list or delete in full to start fresh for the next store run.
